Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It ensures that the individual or system claiming a particular identity is indeed who they say they are. Authentication typically involves presenting credentials, such as a username and password, biometric data (like fingerprints or facial recognition), security tokens, or digital certificates. The primary goal of authentication is to confirm the legitimacy of the user's identity before granting access to a system, application, or service.

Authorization:
Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining what actions or resources an authenticated user or entity is permitted to access or perform. Once a user's identity has been successfully authenticated, authorization determines the level of access they have based on their permissions, roles, privileges, or other access control mechanisms. Authorization ensures that authenticated users can only interact with the data or functionalities that they are explicitly allowed to, according to predefined rules, policies, or access control lists (ACLs). It serves as a crucial layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionalities.
