JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are both popular formats for representing structured data, but they have some key differences:

Syntax:

JSON: JSON uses a lightweight syntax to represent data as key-value pairs. It's inspired by the syntax of JavaScript objects, making it easy for JavaScript to parse and generate.
XML: XML uses a markup language with a hierarchical structure, where data is enclosed in tags. It's more verbose compared to JSON due to its use of opening and closing tags.
Readability:

JSON: JSON is generally considered more readable by humans due to its simple and concise syntax.
XML: XML can be more verbose and complex, especially for nested structures, which might make it less readable for some people.
Data Types:

JSON: JSON supports primitive data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. It does not support more complex data types like dates or binary data directly.
XML: XML doesn't have built-in support for data types. It represents all data as text, allowing developers to define their own data types within the structure.
Namespaces:

JSON: JSON does not support namespaces directly. It's primarily used for representing data, and there's no built-in mechanism for namespacing.
XML: XML supports namespaces, allowing different XML vocabularies to be combined without naming conflicts. This is particularly useful in large-scale applications and data interchange formats.
Parsing:

JSON: JSON parsing is typically faster and more efficient compared to XML parsing, especially in JavaScript environments where JSON is a native data format.
XML: XML parsing can be more resource-intensive due to its more complex structure and the need for parsing libraries to handle it.
Usage:

JSON: JSON is commonly used for web APIs, configuration files, and data interchange between web servers and clients, especially in web development.
XML: XML is often used in situations where extensibility, compatibility with existing systems, or support for complex data structures is required, such as in markup languages like HTML, configuration files, or data exchange between heterogeneous systems.
